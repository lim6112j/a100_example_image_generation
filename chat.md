#### What's wrong? Fix

The error message indicates that there are two main issues:

1. The `protobuf` library is missing from your environment.
2. There's an issue with the tokenizer being based on sentencepiece.

To fix these issues, you need to install the required packages. Here are the steps and the updated files:

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

You need to install `protobuf` and `sentencepiece`. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
pip install protobuf sentencepiece
```

### Step 2: Update Your Code

Ensure that your code is correctly set up to use these packages. Here's an example of what your `main.py` might look like after ensuring all dependencies are installed:

#### main.py
```
import torch
from transformers import FluxPipeline

def main():
    pipe = FluxPipeline.from_pretrained("black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16).to("cuda")
    # Add your pipeline usage code here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Step 3: Ensure Virtual Environment is Activated

Make sure you are running the command within the activated virtual environment:

```sh
source /home/ciel/ai_agent/a100_example/.venv/bin/activate
uv run main.py
```

This should resolve the issues related to missing dependencies. If there are any other specific changes needed in your code, please provide more details or share the relevant files.

#### /ask how to get download a file in remote server with cli command

#### how to get download a file in remote server with cli command

To download a file from a remote server using the command line interface (CLI), you can use various tools depending on the protocol used by the server. Here are some common methods:

### 1. Using `wget`

`wget` is a powerful tool for downloading files from the web.

#### Example:
```sh
wget http://example.com/path/to/file.png -O surreal.png
```

### 2. Using `curl`

`curl` is another versatile command-line tool for transferring data with URLs.

#### Example:
```sh
curl -o surreal.png http://example.com/path/to/file.png
```

### 3. Using `scp` (Secure Copy)

If the file is on a remote server and you have SSH access, you can use `scp`.

#### Example:
```sh
scp user@remote-server:/path/to/file.png /local/path/surreal.png
```

### 4. Using `rsync`

`rsync` is useful for syncing files between local and remote systems.

#### Example:
```sh
rsync -avz user@remote-server:/path/to/file.png /local/path/surreal.png
```

### 5. Using `ftp` or `sftp`

If the file is on an FTP server, you can use `ftp` or `sftp`.

#### Example with `ftp`:
```sh
ftp example.com
# Then use the following commands within the ftp session
get /path/to/file.png surreal.png
bye
```

#### Example with `sftp`:
```sh
sftp user@remote-server
# Then use the following commands within the sftp session
get /path/to/file.png surreal.png
exit
```

### 6. Using `httpie`

`httpie` is a user-friendly HTTP client for the command line.

#### Example:
```sh
http --download http://example.com/path/to/file.png > surreal.png
```

### Summary

Choose the method that best fits your needs based on the protocol and access you have to the remote server. Here are some quick examples:

- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Use `wget`, `curl`, or `httpie`.
- **SSH/SFTP**: Use `scp` or `sftp`.
- **FTP**: Use `ftp` or `sftp`.

If you provide more details about the remote server and the protocol used, I can give a more specific command.

# Image Generation with FluxPipeline

This project uses the `FluxPipeline` from Hugging Face to generate images based on text prompts.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-enabled GPU (for running on GPU)
- Required Python packages: `torch`, `diffusers`, `huggingface_hub`

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install torch diffusers huggingface_hub
```

3. Set up your Hugging Face token:
   - Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
   - Add your Hugging Face token to this file:

```
HF_TOKEN=your_hugging_face_token
```

## Usage

To generate an image, run the `main.py` script with two arguments: the text prompt and the desired filename for the output image.

```bash
python main.py "Your text prompt here" output_image.png
```

### Example

```bash
python main.py "A beautiful sunset over the mountains" sunset.jpg
```

This will generate an image based on the provided text prompt and save it as `sunset.jpg` in the current directory.
```
